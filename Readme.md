The plugin allows you to divide raster values into intervals using methods such as Equal Interval (intervals of equal width), Quantile (intervals based on quantiles), or User (manual interval definition). It is possible to customize the colors for the histogram and classes, making it easier to visually interpret the generated categories. The intervals can be modified, and table data can be saved in standard formats such as CSV or TXT. Additionally, the reclassified raster can be saved and automatically loaded into the QGIS project for further analysis. The plugin includes tools to display essential statistics, such as the count of valid cells, the mean, minimum, maximum, and standard deviation of the raster. It also allows importing interval values directly from external files.
Thanks to its user-friendly interface, the plugin is suitable even for users with limited experience, enabling more in-depth analyses, such as creating thematic maps, identifying key areas, and categorizing data for specific purposes. By automating complex processes, it reduces the risk of errors and saves time. Its versatility makes it applicable in various fields, including environmental analysis, land management, and urban planning. Support for standard formats and direct integration with QGIS ensures compatibility with other tools and software, making this plugin a powerful and flexible solution for improving raster data analysis and presentation.
